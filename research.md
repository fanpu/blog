Just kidding, I realized that research is not really for me. I can't really see myself devoting 6 years to a PhD at this point, and my current plan is to make an impact in industry. But here are some research-like papers that I wrote or co-wrote.

### Efficient Adversarial Attacks against Machine Learning Algorithms: HopSkipJumpAttack
You can access the [paper here]({% link /assets/research/hop_skip_jump_attack.pdf %}). Written in collaboration with Joelle Lim and Albert Gao.

### Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning
You can access the [paper here]({% link /assets/research/atari_deeprl.pdf %}). Written in collaboration with Joelle Lim and Albert Gao.

### Implementation of Unconditionally Secure MPC with Guaranteed Output Delivery with Communication Complexity O(CnÏ†) Bits

The research proposal can be found [here]({% link /assets/research/proposal.pdf %}). The milestones are found [here]({% link /assets/research/milestone.pdf %})
