Here, I talk about my thoughts on the courses that I took throughout my time at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as observations on how my general academic focus and interests changed over the years.

Feel free to ask any questions about the courses at CMU, including those that I
have not taken, in the comments section below.

## Some CMU-Specific Things
This FAQ is mostly geared towards people who are unfamiliar with CMU.

### How does the course numbering work?
From [a note regarding course numbers](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/2017-2018/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/):

>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which
designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the
Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course
numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the
class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore
level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or
graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are
graduate-level. Please consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course
offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.

Here are some of the common ones that you will see as a CS major:
- 15-xxx: Computer Science
- 21-xxx: Mathematical Sciences
- 02-xxx: Computational Biology
- 05-xxx: Human-Computer Interaction
- 10-xxx: Machine Learning
- 11-xxx: Language Technologies Institute
- 16-xxx: Robotics
- 17-xxx: Institute for Software Research
- 18-xxx: Electrical & Computer Engineering
- 98-xxx: Student Led Courses

### Overload Policy
In the *School of Computer Science*, students have a unit cap of 54. Unit overload requests must be submitted to your academic advisor, contingent on past academic
performance.

First-year students are not permitted to overload.

### What are StuCos?
*Student Taught Courses* (StuCos) are low-stress classes taught by other fellow students. They are pass/fail, and are always 3 units each. These are usually fun and interesting topics, such as lockpicking, stand-up comedy, esoteric programming languages, etc.
