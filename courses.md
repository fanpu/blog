Here I share my thoughts on the courses that I took at Carnegie Mellon
University. Note that my experiences with some of these courses can be highly
dependent on the professors, or due to the impact of virtual classes during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Courses with a &#11088; are those that I found transformative,
and those with a &#10084;&#65039; are those that I personally enjoyed a lot.

Feel free to ask any questions about the courses at CMU, including those that I
have not taken, in the comments section below.

A lot of inspiration for this page came from [Wan Shen's CMU course review page](https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/).

Much of it is still a work in progress, apologies about the missing content from many courses.

### Fall 2019
- &#10084;&#65039; 15-319 Cloud Computing

  [This post by Lisa
  Hou](https://medium.com/@zhuojun.hou9270/how-is-cloud-computing-15619-15319-at-cmu-96893f5c2b0)
  discusses the projects of the course in detail. 

  I personally enjoyed this class a lot and the amount of industry knowledge
  that I gained from the course was like having done 3 internships back-to-back,
  which happened to make it really great interview prep as well.

  I would recommend taking the class with friends as it is easy to get stuck in
  weird errors of a complex system that you just learned, and to go for the
  graduate 15-619 option if possible, as it includes a very transformative team
  project that will stretch your wits in finding ways of improving the
  throughput of a distributed web service in the cloud.

### Fall 2020
- &#10084;&#65039; 15-411 [**Compiler
Design**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15411-f20/www/), [Seth
Goldstein](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/)

- &#11088; 15-455 **Undergraduate Complexity Theory**, [Venkatesan Guruswami
](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~venkatg/)

- &#10084;&#65039; 15-445 [**Database Systems**](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2020/), [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/)

  Andy's lectures are a whole lot of fun, and it is hard to not be fired up by
  his enthusiasm and energy for databases. You will get to build the major
  components of a database through the class projects.  Did I also mention that
  Andy really loves Wu-Tang Clan, and [once gave an extra credit question worth
  the entire final if you can list all members of Wu-Tang
  Clan](https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/1204470956141547523)?

  Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this [Youtube
  playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi).

- 15-300 **Research and Innovation in Computer Science**, [Bogdan
Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), [Jonathan
Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/)

  The goal of this class is to encourage undergraduates to contact professors
  and get into research. However, from what I saw people who already started
  doing research before the class simply continued with their existing topics,
  and those that were not engaged in research previously also did not continue
  after the class. In other words, don't expect this class to suddenly turn you
  into a researcher - the motivation must come from within.

- 98-212 StuCo: [**Competitive Computer Security**]({% link
/assets/notes/98_212_Stuco_Syllabus.pdf %}), [Chris
Lambert](https://github.com/cslamber)

  This was a great class on popular cyber-security Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
  topics. The depth of the topics covered go beyond introductory pretty quickly,
  so even CTF veterans will take away a lot from this course. Unfortunately, it
  is unclear if/when the class will be offered again.

Units: 48

I dropped 15-312 Foundations of Programming Languages in the middle of the semester.

### Spring 2021
- &#11088; 15-855 [**Graduate Computational Complexity
Theory**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3b8Gg1DdaJOzYNsaXYLAOKH),
[Ryan O'Donnell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/)

  This was my first graduate theory class, and needless to say I struggled a lot
  with the homework. Interpreting the homework problem was oftentimes
  a challenge in itself, and there were problems that I was stuck on for days,
  which at the time was really depressing and led to me questioning my intelligence
  and aptitude. However, in hindsight I grew a lot from this experience,
  and the euphoria of finally solving something that you have been struggling
  with for ages is indescribable. I gained a lot more confidence in my
  mathematical abilities, and became better in engaging in long periods
  of deep thought about a problem.

  Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this [Youtube
  playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3b8Gg1DdaJOzYNsaXYLAOKH).

- &#10084;&#65039; 21-301 [**Combinatorics**](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~jmackey/math301/syll.html),
[John Mackey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uOCVq1cAAAAJ&hl=en)

  I loved 15-151 (Concepts in Mathematics) and after that class I swore that if
  Mackey ever taught another class, I will take it for sure. Mackey is just as
  great and fun in Combinatorics as he was in Concepts. The homework is
  challenging, and the exams even more so. After the first midterm (where the
  variance was really high) he explained that he had to make the course
  challenging because there were many people who already came in with a lot of
  math competition background, the bulk of which involves combinatorics, and he
  did not want them to be bored. Unfortunately I did not have such a background
  and struggled with solving all the problems during the stressful time-crunch
  of the 50 minute midterm (I can't really think creatively when I am stressed),
  and this class ended up being the only B that I got in my undergraduate
  career (all others A). That said, I don't really care about my GPA and my main
  goal is to optimize for learning, so I am still very glad I took this class.
  Not having a 4.0 also ironically gave me more courage to take a more challenging
  course schedule in the future, as I no longer had to worry about losing my
  perfect GPA.

- &#10084;&#65039; 85-102 **Introduction to Psychology**, Kody Manke
  
  My view of psychology was pretty misguided (think Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung)
  before coming into this class, and it ended up being one of my favorite geneds.
  Kody is a very energetic and fun lecturer, and the class helped to open my eyes
  to many social phenomenom that I encounter in daily life, such as stereotype
  threat and priming.

- 10-701 [**Introduction to Machine
Learning**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10701_Spring21/index.html),
[Geoff Gordon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/), [Aarti
Singh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/)

- 15-354 [**Computation and Discrete Math**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sutner/CDM/index.html), [Klaus Sutner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sutner/index.html)

- 15-440 [**Distributed Systems**](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-440/),
[Mahadev Satyanarayanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/), [Padmanabhan
Pillai](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/pspillai/)

  Having already taken 15-410 (Operating Systems) which covers many concurrency
  and cache coherence concepts, 15-319 (Cloud Computing) which has an entire
  module on distributed consensus protocols, 15-445 (Database Systems) which
  talks about distributed databases, I did not really get much out of this
  course and wish I had taken something else. The projects were fairly
  straightforward compared to the other systems classes I have already taken.
  This course is usually considered the easiest systems class and I would only
  recommened it if you are new to systems or if this is the only systems class
  that you are planning to take.

- 98-242 **StuCo: Introduction to Esoteric Programming Languages**, [Ari Cohn](https://wafflecohn.github.io/), Jonathan Loungani

Units: 69

### Fall 2021
- &#10084;&#65039; 15-459 [**Quantum
Computation**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3YL5qLskC6xQ24JpMwOAeJz),
[Ryan
O'Donnell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/)

  This course covers the theoretical aspects of quantum computing, starting from
  the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb algorithm (I bet this already got your attention) to
  classical results like Shor's and Grover's algorithm. The class starts off initially
  relatively slowly, but then ramps up in the middle half. 

  A curious trait of this class is that all weekly homeworks are optional, but you can turn
  in two selected problems per week to offset the weightage of your midterms and final exam.
  As a result, it is possible to score worse in the class if you turn in garbage for
  your homework but do well on the exam. My personal recommendation and what I
  did is to always do all the problems and turn in all the selected problems so that
  you can receive feedback. I only missed turning in homework for one week due to
  many overlapping deadlines from other classes. This approach helps you stay on
  track with the class and improves your confidence of your abilities during the midterms.

  Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this [Youtube
  playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3YL5qLskC6xQ24JpMwOAeJz).

- &#11088; 15-641 [**Computer Networks**](https://computer-networks.github.io/fa21/), [Peter Steenkiste
](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/)

  I dedicated an [entire post]({% post_url
  2022-08-15-cmu-computer-networks-review %}) to review this course. Trust me,
  it's worth a read! But the TLDR is this course is very different from other
  systems courses, and you will likely stand to gain a lot from it even if you
  already have a lot of systems experience.
  
- 15-317 [**Constructive Logic**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f21/), [Karl Crary](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/)

  It can be hard to see how this class is relevant without subsequently taking
  other PL classes. I found the theoretical foundations gained from this course
  immensely helpful for preparing for 15-312 and 15-819. However, if you are
  only planning to take a single PL class, I would recommend another course that
  is more immediately applicable.

- 15-356 [**Introduction to Cryptography**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15356-f21/), [Elaine Shi](http://elaineshi.com/)

  I found the class relatively easy as I had already taken 15-330 prior to this, and so I only started seeing
  new content near the middle of the course. The last part of the course covers
  blockchains and distributed consensus protocols, which is one of Elaine's major research areas.
  There were some pretty cool content like oblivious data structures,
  multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, but personally I wished
  that it went faster and covered more content like lattice-based and post-quantum cryptography.

- 15-462 [**Computer Graphics**](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/), [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/)

  The course assignments are pretty fun. and there's many moments of instant
  gratification, such as when you see your ray tracer paint a beautiful image
  of light refracting through glass balls. The course staff cares deeply about
  the class and there's a very active Discord server for the class to ask questions,
  get help, and post memes. While I think I am pretty competent at systems debugging,
  I found that debugging graphics code required a completely different set of
  skills since the visible effect of bugs are usually the result of many
  different matrix operations, which can be quite unintuitive to trace back to
  the source. It was a great learning experience for me.

  Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this [Youtube
  playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz2emSh0UQ5iOdT2xRHFHL7E).
  In fact, when I took this course we were told to watch the lectures from this
  playlist asynchronously before class, and lecture time was reserved for
  in-class activities and Q&A. So together with the publicly available homework
  materials from [the course website](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/)
  you can effectively self-study the class.

- 18-746 **[Storage Systems](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece746/)**, [Greg
Ganger](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/), [George
Amvrosiadis](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/), [Huaicheng
Li](https://huaicheng.github.io/)

  During the first lecture, the professor talked about NAND flash alll the way
  down to the gory details about how it is implemented with MOSFET cells, and
  how reads, writes, and erases are performed at the voltage control level. I
  knew nothing about ECE, had no idea what was going on, and thought that if
  the entire course was going to be so low-level (since it is from the ECE
  department after all) I was probably going to drop the class.

  Fortunately, that was not necessary as most of the subsequent lectures stayed
  at the layer of abstraction of the software level, and therefore don't
  be afraid to take this class if you are not a ECE major. 

  There are two big assignments in the class. In the first project, you will
  implement a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) for a SSD, and optimize your
  implementation such that it preserves the lifespan of the SSD for as long as
  possible for different workloads. This is because NAND flash can only tolerate a
  certain number of erases before it fails. In the second project, you will
  implement a FUSE-based filesystem (cloudFS) that automatically saves large objects
  to the cloud (i.e AWS S3), performs optimizations like de-deduplicating
  identical segments of stored files, and extend it to be able to 
  read/write large files that can fit on the cloud but not on disk
  by performing segment-based read/write operations.

  Overall I thought it was a good class that provides you with a good sense of
  where the bottlenecks of various I/O-based workloads could lie (i.e database
  queries) for different filesystem designs, which is quite useful for
  optimizing the performance of many real-world systems you might work on in the future.
  It also gives you a good understanding of how many distributed filesystems (NFS, AFS, Google Filesystem)
  and storage systems (Google BigTable) that big tech companies use works.

- 84-380 **US Grand Strategy**, Andrew Stravers

  As someone who is interested in history and geopolitics I really liked this
  class. It offers a critical and balanced examination of past US foreign policy
  and grand strategy under various administrations. It was refreshing to see
  opinions which are not just variants of US/West is good and
  Russia/China/non-democracies are bad which permeates online discourse.
  Classes are structured such that the first hour is spent on lecturing, and the
  remaining 20 minutes is spent on group discussions.

Units: 75

### Spring 2022
- &#11088; 10-725 &nbsp; **Convex Optimization**, [Yuanzhi
Li](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuanzhil/)

  I did not enjoy 10-701 as it covered a lot of content, but did not go into much detail about many topics,
  and I felt like there was no true understanding and everything was very hand-wavey. That
  experience made me hesistant to take any other ML classes.
  
  10-725 changed that for me, as Yuanzhi Li started from first principles and
  rigorously proved how many machine learning algorithms can converge in some
  amount of steps given various assumptions. For instance, just in the 
  second lecture you will learn how gradient descent can converge to the optimum
  up to an epsilon error in a number of states which is proportionate to a
  chosen learning rate, given assumptions on the smoothness of a convex optimization
  landscape. This will then be extended to more complicated settings such as stochastic gradient
  descent, gradient descent with momentum (ADAM), distributed gradient descent, and even
  quantum optimization.

  Yuanzhi Li also understands that the students taking the class have very
  different learning objectives, and therefore the homework contains a mix of
  required and bonus problems, where the bonus problems are usually
  significantly more challenging than the required ones, but are tailored for
  people who really want to get deep into this stuff. The grading policy is
  extremely gentle and you essentially only have to score just half the points
  on the required problems to get an A-. The late day policy is also extremely
  generous (14 days), so it is quite a good class to take if you want some
  flexibility in your schedule.

- &#11088; 15-751 **[A Theorist's
Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX)**,
[Ryan O'Donnell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/)

  This class aims to prepare students for doing theoretical computer science (TCS)
  research in the future. It covers a wide range of topics that frequently crop up in
  TCS research (see the playlist below for a taste), and the homework is challenging
  but fun. 
  I have been previously exposed to a number of the topics covered in previous
  courses, but still found many of the topics new to me such as spectral graph
  theory and semidefinite relaxations incredibly cool.  It is usually only
  offered once every few years, so if you have any interest in doing TCS-related
  research I would highly recommend that you take the class.

  Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this [Youtube
  playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX).
  It also includes recitation videos where Ryan goes through homework problems.

- &#10084;&#65039; 15-312 **Foundations of Programming Languages**, [Jan
Hoffmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/)

  The programming portion of the homework is the most fun part of this class.
  You will get to write typecheckers and implement the dynamics of various
  well-specified languages, starting from the simple lambda calculus to
  concurrent Algol (which is Golang-like). This class is great for 
  appreciating language design and understanding the pitfalls and
  antipatterns that pervades most programming languages used in industry.

- &#10084;&#65039; 21-355 **Principles of Real Analysis I**, [Robin
Neumayer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~rneumaye/)
  
  It is true that different sections of math classes taught by different
  professors are run like entirely different classes, so your experience with
  any math class highly depends on which professor you are with. I am really
  glad that I took the class under Robin, whose passion for teaching, and care
  and concern shown towards students (in one of the first few lectures she took
  some time to have everyone introduce themselves so she can know everyone on a
  more personal level), made me really enjoy the class and the subject matter.
  It also helped that she followed Rudin pretty closely, so anything that I was
  unclear about can be easily checked. Her weekly homework has reasonable
  difficulty and is quite fun.

  The pace of the course under Robin is faster than most standard analysis classes,
  where we covered up to Chapter 7 (Sequences and Series of Functions) in Rudin.
  I enjoyed the class so much that I wanted to take another analysis class in the
  future, which led me to take General Topology (21-651) in the subsequent semester.
  If you are interested in taking analysis, I cannot recommend doing it with Robin
  enough.

- &#10084;&#65039; 21-484 **Graph Theory**, [Wesley
Pegden](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~wes/)

  The class was quite fast-paced and many times I felt quite lost during the
  longer proofs (some of them took multiple classes to prove). I definitely had
  to review the content after each lecture to get a better sense of the proof
  technique. However, this is more due to the complicated setup of many of the
  proofs. Wesley is a great teacher and I really appreciate how he would
  re-explain the key ideas many times in different methods so that we can
  understand them better. His exams are reasonable, and he will send out a
  review sheet between each midterm where you are only expected to remember the
  statements for some of the more complicated
  theorems, instead of being able to reproduce them fully.
  
  The textbook for the clas (Graph Theory by Diestel) is quite tersely written
  as it is intended for a graduate audience, so definitely do not miss lectures!

- 15-819 **Advanced Topics in Programming Language Theory**, [Robert
Harper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/)

  The class covered many advanced topics in PL theory where there isn't much
  publicly available resources on, so when I got confused during lecture
  it was quite hard to find other materials online to supplement my learning.
  Very often I would end up on the nLab wiki, and I'm pretty sure
  anyone who has visited that knows that it's not entirely the best place
  for beginners to understand anything.

  The class is offered pass/fail to reduce stress, and homeworks are assigned weekly.
  You will be asked to re-do questions that you get wrong as Bob really wants
  to make sure that you understand the material. I think I generally had
  a ok-understanding of what was going on in the class until the segment on
  logical frameworks, where it became very abstract. I still hope to 
  rectify this gap in understanding someday when I have time, perhaps by playing
  around with Twelf.

- 16-385 **[Computer Vision](http://16385.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/)**,
[Matthew O'Toole](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motoole2/)

  I took this class as a follow-up to Computer Graphics (15-462).  Many computer
  vision techniques covered will abuse linear algebra heavily, so if you were
  not already an expert in SVD decompositions and making use of
  eigenvalues/eigenvectors for engineering, this course will definitely make you
  one. You will also get very comfortable with convolutions and some elementary
  Fourier analysis. A major part of the course also covers convolutional neural
  networks, which is the mainstay of many modern computer vision methods. 

- 18-358 **[Introduction to Amateur Radio](https://tomzajdel.com/ece358/)**,
[Tom Zajdel (AI6CU)](https://tomzajdel.com/)

  To be very honest I was a pretty bad student for this course. Given the 
  workload of my other classes, I had to skip many lectures and only studied
  extensively for the FCC licensing exam, because passing the exam
  is the only requirement for passing the class.

## Some CMU-Specific Things
This FAQ is mostly geared towards people who are unfamiliar with CMU.

### How does the course numbering work?
From [a note regarding course numbers](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/2017-2018/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/):

>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which
designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the
Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course
numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the
class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore
level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or
graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are
graduate-level. Please consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course
offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.

Here are some of the common ones that you will see as a CS major:
- 15-xxx: Computer Science
- 21-xxx: Mathematical Sciences
- 02-xxx: Computational Biology
- 05-xxx: Human-Computer Interaction
- 10-xxx: Machine Learning
- 11-xxx: Language Technologies Institute
- 16-xxx: Robotics
- 17-xxx: Institute for Software Research
- 18-xxx: Electrical & Computer Engineering
- 98-xxx: Student Led Courses

### Overload Policy
In the *School of Computer Science*, students have a unit cap of 54. Unit overload requests must be submitted to your academic advisor, contingent on past academic
performance.

First-year students are not permitted to overload.

### What are StuCos?
*Student Taught Courses* (StuCos) are low-stress classes taught by other fellow students. They are pass/fail, and are always 3 units each. These are usually fun and interesting topics, such as lockpicking, stand-up comedy, esoteric programming languages, etc.

<br>
