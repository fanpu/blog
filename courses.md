Here I share my thoughts on the courses that I took at Carnegie Mellon
University. Note that my experiences with some of these courses can be highly
dependent on the professors, or due to the impact of virtual classes during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Courses with a &#11088; are those that I found transformative,
and those with a &#10084;&#65039; are those that I personally enjoyed a lot.

Feel free to ask any questions about the courses at CMU, including those that I
have not taken, in the comments section below.

A lot of inspiration for this page came from [Wan Shen's CMU course review page](https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/).

- 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming
- 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems

- 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations 
- 98-317 StuCo: Type Theory (Hype for Types)

Units: 57

### Fall 2019
- &#10084;&#65039; 15-319 Cloud Computing

  [This post by Lisa
  Hou](https://medium.com/@zhuojun.hou9270/how-is-cloud-computing-15619-15319-at-cmu-96893f5c2b0)
  discusses the projects of the course in detail. 

  I personally enjoyed this class a lot and the amount of industry knowledge
  that I gained from the course was like having done 3 internships back-to-back,
  which happened to make it really great interview prep as well.

  I would recommend taking the class with friends as it is easy to get stuck in
  weird errors of a complex system that you just learned, and to go for the
  graduate 15-619 option if possible, as it includes a very transformative team
  project that will stretch your wits in finding ways of improving the
  throughput of a distributed web service in the cloud.
  
- 15-330 Introduction to Computer Security
- 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms
- 21-268 Multi-dimensional Calculus

I dropped 21-373 Algebraic Structures in the last week of classes.

### Spring 2020
- &#11088; 15-410 Operating Systems Design and Implementation
- 15-259 Probability and Computing
- 15-260 Statistics and Computing
- 15-451 Algorithm Design and Analysis
- 33-228 Electronics I
- 79-396 Music and Society in 19th and 20th Century Europe and the U.S.

### Fall 2020
- &#10084;&#65039; 15-411 Compiler Design
- &#11088; 15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory

- 15-445 Database Systems
- 98-212 StuCo: [**Competitive Computer Security**]({% link /assets/notes/98_212_Stuco_Syllabus.pdf %})

  This was a great class on concepts in cyber-security Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
  competitions taught by [Chris Lambert](https://github.com/cslamber). The depth
  of the topics covered go beyond introductory pretty quickly, so even CTF
  veterans will take away a lot from this course. The syllabus is mirrored [here]({% link /assets/notes/98_212_Stuco_Syllabus.pdf %}).



Units: 48

I dropped 15-312 Foundations of Programming Languages in the middle of the semester.

  playlist asynchronously before class, and lecture time was reserved for
  in-class activities and Q&A. So together with the publicly available homework
  materials from [the course website](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/)
  you can effectively self-study the class.

## Some CMU-Specific Things
This FAQ is mostly geared towards people who are unfamiliar with CMU.

### How does the course numbering work?
From [a note regarding course numbers](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/2017-2018/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/):

>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which
designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the
Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course
numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the
class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore
level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or
graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are
graduate-level. Please consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course
offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.

Here are some of the common ones that you will see as a CS major:
- 15-xxx: Computer Science
- 21-xxx: Mathematical Sciences
- 02-xxx: Computational Biology
- 05-xxx: Human-Computer Interaction
- 10-xxx: Machine Learning
- 11-xxx: Language Technologies Institute
- 16-xxx: Robotics
- 17-xxx: Institute for Software Research
- 18-xxx: Electrical & Computer Engineering
- 98-xxx: Student Led Courses

### Overload Policy
In the *School of Computer Science*, students have a unit cap of 54. Unit overload requests must be submitted to your academic advisor, contingent on past academic
performance.

First-year students are not permitted to overload.

### What are StuCos?
*Student Taught Courses* (StuCos) are low-stress classes taught by other fellow students. They are pass/fail, and are always 3 units each. These are usually fun and interesting topics, such as lockpicking, stand-up comedy, esoteric programming languages, etc.
