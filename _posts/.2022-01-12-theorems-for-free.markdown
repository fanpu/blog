While there is no such thing as a free lunch, there are some things that come pretty close. In this post we take a look at parametricity, which allows us to deduce theorems about a polymorphic function without even looking at the definition of the function itself (and thus the notion that it comes for 'free'). If you were originally thinking about how you could financially profit off this, I hope you are not too disappointed!

<!-- It would be helpful to first read [my previous post on universal types]({% post_url 2022-01-11-universal-types %}) if you are new to the idea, as knowledge of polymorphic  -->

Suppose I give you a polymorphic function of type `'a -> 'a -> 'a`. By the sheer power of neurons firing in your brain you can already conclude that this type can only be inhabited by two possible terms: $$\lambda.x\ \lambda.y.\ x$$ or $$\lambda.x\ \lambda.y.\ y$$.
