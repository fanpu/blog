I finished watching Seishun Buta Yaro (Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai) recently, and really enjoyed the anime. It explored themes of finding one's identity, and dealing with social anxiety during adolescent years. In the show, students are inflicted by a fictional disease called Adolescence Syndrome when they are severely affected by the things happening around them, whose symptoms depends on the specific reason why a person is mentally distraught. Rio Futaba, the president of the science club in the school, tries to explain the reasons for Adolescence Syndrome using quantum mechanics principles throughout the show. Unfortunately, most of it was poorly applied, and could be harmful in reinforcing misconceptions of quantum mehanics. In this post, I examine each of her claims and describe why they don't make sense.

### Mai's Arc and Quantum States
In the first arc, Futaba explains that the invisibility of Mai to everyone in their school is analogous to the thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat. She says that because nobody in the school was actively observing Mai, she begins to become invisible to them. Sakuta, the protagonist, then refuses to sleep, believing that falling asleep will also cause him to be unable to perceive Mai afterwards.

The Schrödinger's cat thought experiment is used to highlight the point that if you are handed a quantum system with an unknown state, it remains in a superposition of its possible states until you measure it, after which its state collapses into the measured state with 100% probability. 

Therefore, just observing Mai-san once is enough to trigger a collapse in her quantum state (if that even makes any sense at all). One can argue that her quantum states can always be changing due to interactions with the environment, but then in practice stable quantum superpositions are extremely hard to maintain anyway (otherwise we will have quantum computers by now).

### Tomoe's Arc
In Tomoe's arc, Sakuta pretends to be Tomoe's boyfriend in order to help with her reputation at school. However, when it is time for their fake relationship to end, Tomoe

<!-- proposed to raise the question of when a quantum state collapses to a particular 

originally used to demonstrate that the state of a quantum particle with probabilistic states cannot be known until you measure it. -->

 <!-- A quantum bit (qubit) can be represented by the following state in the \|$$ 0 \rangle$$ and \|$$ 1 \rangle$$ (pronounced ket zero and ket one respectively) basis:

$$ a | 0 \rangle + b | 1 \rangle \text{ subject to } a, b \in \mathbb{C}, a^2 + b^2 = 1$$

For instance, a possible quantum state can be $$a = 0.8, b = -0.6$$, since $$0.8^2 + 0.6^2 = 0.64 + 0.36 = 1$$.

If you are given a qubit with unknown state \|$$\varphi \rangle$$, the only thing that you can do to gain more information about it is to measure it in a particular orthogonal basis (the 0/1 basis mentioned previously being one choice).  -->
