### Breakpoints
Shorthand: `b`

Break on `main`
```gdb
break main
```

Get info about breakpoints
```gdb
info breakpoints
# or
i b
```

Clear breakpoint
```
clear main
```

Enable/disable breakpoint (based on breakpoint number from `i b`)
```
enable 1
```

### Stepping through Code
Proceed to next statement in function. Note that `next` steps over function calls.
```
next
```
