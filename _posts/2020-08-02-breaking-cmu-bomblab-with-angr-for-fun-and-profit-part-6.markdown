Hello from Part 6 of this series on cracking CMU's Bomblab with Angr. If you are new here, I would recommend starting with part 1 [here](breaking-cmu-bomblab-with-angr-for-fun-and-profit).

### Phase 6

Let's disassemble Phase 6:

It looks like it is using the same `read_six_numbers` function from Phase 2, and the six numbers are at the bottom of the stack again. One small difference is that before `read_six_numbers` is called, `r13` is set to `rsp` in line 9. Since `r13` is a callee saved register, we need to initialize it to `rsp`.

 
{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
def phase_6(argv):
    path_to_binary = argv[1]
    project = angr.Project(path_to_binary)

    # Tell Angr where to start executing 
    start_addr = 0x0040110b
    initial_state = project.factory.blank_state(addr=start_addr)


    num_12 = claripy.BVS('num_12', 64)
    num_34 = claripy.BVS('num_34', 64)
    num_56 = claripy.BVS('num_56', 64)

    initial_state.stack_push(num_56)
    initial_state.stack_push(num_34)
    initial_state.stack_push(num_12)

    # Setup initial registers
    initial_state.regs.r13 = initial_state.regs.rsp
    initial_state.regs.rsi = initial_state.regs.rsp

    # Create a simulation manager initialized with the starting state
    simulation = project.factory.simgr(initial_state)
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

With this done, that means we can just re-use the rest of the code for Phase 2 and it will just work, right? Rightttttt?

Well, no, unfortunately not. I tried it and the script ran for 1 minute... 2 minutes... 5 minutes... 10 minutes...,  and I did not have a good feeling about this as my laptop was becoming something of a portable heater at this point. From the disassembly you can see that there are a lot of jumps and comparisons, way more than in previous phases, and this is leading to state explosion. We need to find a better way. 

### Mitigating State Explosion by Splitting Up Analysis
We mitigate the exponential growth in states by decreasing the depth of the search tree of the simulation manager. This can be done by splitting up the function into multiple distinct parts, and then searching through each of them in order. This way, we will search through multiple trees of smaller depths, which could make the problem tractable. Of course, the assumption here is that the function can indeed be split into distinct parts. Let's try to verify this assumption by seeing how the code jumps around. I decided to do this with Radare, which allows us to see this in a more graphical manner. We could manually eyeball it with GDB's output as well, but that is just too painful.

Let's open up Radare, and seek to our `phase_6` function with `s`:

{% highlight c linenos %}
{% raw %}
$ r2 bomb
[0x00400c90]> s sym.phase_6
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now output the disassembly with `pdf`, which stands for Print Disassemble Function:

![Disassembly graph of phase_6](/assets/images/screenshots/phase_6_r2.png)

You can see the lines on the left going up and down. Those represents the jumps that can be taken. We also see that there are some obvious blocks in the structure. My original intuition was that the address at 0x00401158 seemed like a pretty good place to split the blocks, since it just finished a bunch of complicated logic in the first half and it looked like a natural transition point. Let's see how this looks like in code:

{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
    block_1_end = 0x00401158 # after the first distinct block. Note that this will change later
    block_2_end = 0x00401203 # right before ret

    explode_addr = 0x0040143a # explode_bomb

    # Find all possible ways to reach find condition
    while len(simulation.active) > 0:
        simulation.explore(find=block_1_end, avoid=explode_addr)

    # Find out how many states we have now
    if simulation.found:
        block_1_states = simulation.found
        print("States found after block 1: ", len(block_1_states))
    else:
        raise Exception('Could not find the solution')
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I called the two blocks that we divide the function into as `block 1` and `block 2`. `block_1_end` is where we split the two blocks apart. `block_2_end` is simply the end of the function.

An important point to highlight is that instead of just performing `simulation.explore` and `simulation.found` like previously, now we need to find all the states that can reach `block_1_end`. If we just did `simulation.found` instead, it would stop at the first valid solution that it found, which may not include the states that are actually necessary for us to get to the final solution. Therefore, we keep exploring while `simulation.active` is true, which means that there are still available states to explore.

This means that `block_1_states` will hold all the possible states that can reach `block_1_end`, and we can then use each of them as a launching point to reach the end of the function:


{% highlight c linenos %}
{% raw %}
    for state in block_1_states:
        simulation = project.factory.simgr(state)
        simulation.explore(find=block_2_end, avoid=explode_addr)

        # Check whether we found a solution
        if simulation.found:
            solution_state = simulation.found[0]

            num_12_sol = solution_state.se.eval(num_12, cast_to=int)
            num_34_sol = solution_state.se.eval(num_34, cast_to=int)
            num_56_sol = solution_state.se.eval(num_56, cast_to=int)

            def unpack_ints(n):
                lower_32_mask = (1 << 32) - 1
                return (n & lower_32_mask, (n >> 32) & lower_32_mask)

            num_1_sol, num_2_sol = unpack_ints(num_12_sol)
            num_3_sol, num_4_sol = unpack_ints(num_34_sol)
            num_5_sol, num_6_sol = unpack_ints(num_56_sol)

            print(f"{num_1_sol} {num_2_sol} {num_3_sol} {num_4_sol} {num_5_sol} {num_6_sol}")
            return

    raise Exception('Could not find the solution')
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above, we begin afresh from each of the states that we found in block 1, and then try to see if it leads to a solution. This time round we only need to grab the first valid solution, like usual.

I tried running the script: 

{% highlight c linenos %}
{% raw %}
$ python solve.py bomb
States found after block 1:  1
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

What?! There is only 1 state found after block 1? That seems like we did not reduce the depth of the search tree by much, since we did not reduce the number of times it branched. Indeed, I kept waiting and waiting and...there was no additional output.

For this to work, we need more states to be found after block 1, the more the merrier (but not so much that now you have state explosion in block 1).

The next address I tried to set `block_1_end` to was `0x00401181`, which is right after another distinct mini logic block:

Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Border relations with Canada have never been better.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?

It worked! We've come a long way and you should be proud of yourselves. If any of you actually solved this before (wink wink 15-213 students), you would remember how long this phase took, where you would slowly realise that you were dealing with a linked list and then you probably had to graph out the pointers in the linked list to figure out what their relationships were, but Angr solved it without us having to be aware of what is happening at all!

Thanks for reading thus far, and I hope to see you again for the last and final phase - the Secret Phase, which you can find [here](breaking-cmu-bomblab-with-angr-for-fun-and-profit-part-7)!
