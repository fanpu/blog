Today I created a new tab for my blog, 'Dev Cheat Sheets'. This page will contain common commmand line commands that I use often. I have a habit of simply performing a reverse-i-search on my terminal when I need a particular command, and therefore I have never really bothered to firmly commit them to memory or find a proper place to record them. However, this gave me problems when I switch between accounts on my system, or when I am SSH'd into a remote machine, where the shell history is different. As such, I have finally decided to consolidate all these notes in one place on my blog, where I think it would be helpful for other people as well. It is still quite slim right now, I will be updating them as I go.
