This is Part 5 on cracking CMU's Bomblab with Angr. If you just stumbled upon this, I would recommend starting with part 1 [here](https://fanpu.io/breaking-cmu-bomblab-with-angr-for-fun-and-profit).

### Phase 5

Let's disassemble Phase 5:

End of assembler dump.

We see `strings_not_equal`, like in Phase 1, and also `string_length`. Also, right after the `string_length` call there is a comparison with 6, so we can assume that it wants 6 bytes of input. Let's craft the input again in the same stack frame as the function by setting `rdi` to our symbolic bitvector of 6 bytes:


{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
def phase_5(argv):
    # Create an Angr project.
    path_to_binary = argv[1] # :string
    project = angr.Project(path_to_binary)

    # Tell Angr where to start executing 
    start_addr = 0x00401062
    initial_state = project.factory.blank_state(addr=start_addr)

    fake_addr = 0x40000000
    input_len = 6
    phase_5_input = claripy.BVS('phase_5_input', input_len * 8)
    initial_state.memory.store(fake_addr, phase_5_input)
    initial_state.regs.rdi = fake_addr
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Recall how we had to replace `strings_not_equal` with our own custom implementation back in Phase 1 to avoid state explosion? I recently found out that there was a really simple way of doing this by using the built-in libc ones that Angr already helpfully provides. For instance, `strings_not_equal` can simply be replaced with the libc `strcmp`, whose definition can be found [here](https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/procedures/libc/strcmp.py). Similarly, `string_length` is the same as the libc `strlen`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/procedures/libc/strlen.py). So let us replace those using this method, to avoid state explosion:


{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
    strcmp = angr.SIM_PROCEDURES['libc']['strcmp']
    strlen = angr.SIM_PROCEDURES['libc']['strlen']

    strings_not_equal_symbol = 'strings_not_equal'
    string_length_symbol = "string_length"

    project.hook_symbol(strings_not_equal_symbol, strcmp())
    project.hook_symbol(string_length_symbol, strlen())
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we set our success address to be at the `ret` statement, and the same avoid address as before:

{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
    # Create a simulation manager initialized with the starting state
    simulation = project.factory.simgr(initial_state)

    success_addr = 0x004010f3 # right before ret
    explode_addr = 0x0040143a # explode_bomb

    simulation.explore(find=success_addr, avoid=explode_addr)

    if simulation.found:
        solution_state = simulation.found[0]

        # Case symbolic value to bytes
        solution = solution_state.se.eval(phase_5_input, cast_to=bytes)
        print(solution)
    else:
        raise Exception('Could not find the solution')
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Almost There?
Let's try running it!

We indeed got a solution, but those are not ASCII printable characters! Of course, we can pipe the input to the binary with something like pwntools, but this seems to not be the point of the assignment. This is where we introduce the new concept of adding constraints to our input.

### Adding Constraints
We want to constrain our input bytes such that they are in the printable range. For simplicity, I will restrict it further to be smallest range that include the alphanumeric range, which includes a few non-alphanumeric characters as well. This will range from '0' (0x30) to 'z' (0x7A), which you can quickly verify by pulling up an ASCII table with `man ascii`. 

We'll add these constraints right before we build the simulation:

{% highlight python linenos %}
{% raw %}
    def constrain_printable(c):
        return claripy.And(ord('0') <= c , c <= ord('z'))

    for i in range(input_len):
        initial_state.solver.add(constrain_printable(phase_5_input.get_byte(i)))
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we will either get a solution that is printable, or perhaps no solution at all. Let's try:

Fantastic! Let's try this input on the bomb:

{% highlight c linenos %}
{% raw %}
$ ./bomb
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Border relations with Canada have never been better.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
1 2 4 8 16 32
That's number 2.  Keep going!
1 311
Halfway there!
7 0
So you got that one.  Try this one.
9?>567
Good work!  On to the next...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Looks like it worked! Thanks for reading so far, and I hope you enjoyed it!
