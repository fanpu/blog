Hello! I am Fan Pu Zeng from Singapore, and I am currently based in Pittsburgh. I go by my first name Fan Pu. My amateur radio callsign is [KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), and am currently pursuing another year of Master's in Computer Science at the same place.

<!-- I used to work as a software engineer at [Saleswhale](https://saleswhale.com) before I enrolled in college. 
I have interned at [Asana](https://asana.com/) under the Infrastructure Management team, [Facebook](https://about.facebook.com/meta) on the Tupperware Scheduler Production Engineering team, and twice at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) as a Linux Engineer Intern.  -->

This blog was started on 24 June 2018 and is built using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

I write mainly about computer science, work, startups, and interesting new
things that I learned. I also maintain a CMU [Course Review]( {% link
courses.md %}) page that some people find helpful.  The pictures on the banners
are all taken by yours truly during my hiking trips. I hope you enjoy your stay
here!
