Hello! I am Fan Pu Zeng from Singapore, and I am currently based in Pittsburgh.
Please call me Fan Pu. 
I am a senior in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) studying Computer Science. I used to work as a software engineer at
[Saleswhale](https://saleswhale.com) before I enrolled in college. In the following summer, I interned at [Asana](https://asana.com/) under the Infrastructure Management team. I then spent my next summer interning at [Facebook](https://about.facebook.com/meta) on the Tupperware Scheduler Production Engineering team. Most recently, I interned at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) as a Linux Engineer Intern. 

This blog was started on 24 June 2018 and is built using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

I write mainly about computer science, work, startups, and interesting new things that I learned. The pictures on the banners are all taken by yours truly during my hiking trips. I hope you enjoy your stay here!
